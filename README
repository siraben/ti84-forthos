                                    Hi, TI!

hiti is a minimal template for building an operating system for TI calculators.

                                  DEPENDENCIES

The build process depends on the following tools:

kcc             https://github.com/KnightOS/kcc
scas            https://github.com/KnightOS/scas
mkrom           https://github.com/KnightOS/mkrom
mktiupgrade     https://github.com/KnightOS/mktiupgrade

And for debugging, optionally depends on:

z80e            https://github.com/KnightOS/z80e

                                   COMPILING

To compile for a platform, use `make $PLATFORM`. See platforms.make for a list
of available platforms. If unspecified, we build for the TI-84+ SE.

The outputs are hiti-$PLATFORM.rom (for emulators and debuggers) and
hiti-$PLATFORM.8xu (for installing on a real calculator).

                                   DEBUGGING

Use the `make z80e` target to run your OS in the z80e debugger. You should see a
prompt waiting for you to enter debugger commands - use "run" to start running
the CPU. You can pause execution again by hitting Ctrl+C in the debugger
console. Use "?" for a list of debugger commands.

If you put "set knightos" into ~/.config/z80erc, it'll show your original source
code in the debugger.
