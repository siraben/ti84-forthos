                                    Hi, TI!

hiti is a minimal template for building an operating system for TI calculators.

                                  DEPENDENCIES

The build process depends on the following tools:

scas            https://github.com/KnightOS/scas
mkrom           https://github.com/KnightOS/mkrom
mktiupgrade     https://github.com/KnightOS/mktiupgrade

And for debugging, optionally depends on:

z80e            https://github.com/KnightOS/z80e

                                   COMPILING

To compile for a platform, use `make $PLATFORM`. See platforms.make for a list
of available platforms. If unspecified, we build for the TI-84+ SE.

                                   DEBUGGING

Use the `make z80e` target to run your OS in the z80e debugger. Press Ctrl+C at
the terminal to interrupt execution and examine the calculator's state. The ?
command will print available debugger commands.
